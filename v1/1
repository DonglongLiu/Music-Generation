Fig. 3 | Country-level clusters. a, Hierarchical cluster of countries based 
on average marginal causal effect. One hundred and thirty countries with 
at least 100 respondents were selected (range, 101–448,125). The three 
colours of the dendrogram branches represent three large clusters—Western, 
Eastern, and Southern. Country names are coloured according to the 
Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map 2010–201421. Distributions across the three 
clusters reveal stark differences. For instance, cluster 2 (Eastern) consists 
mostly of countries of Islamic and Confucian cultures. By contrast, cluster 
1 (Western) has large percentages of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox 
countries in Europe. b, Mean AMCE z-scores of the three major clusters. 
Radar plot of the mean AMCE z-scores of three clusters reveals a striking 
pattern of differences between the clusters along the nine attributes. 
For example, countries belonging to the Southern cluster show a strong 
preference for sparing females compared to countries in other clusters
